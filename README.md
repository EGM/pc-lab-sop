# City of Palm Coast :poop: Lab :poop: Standard Operating Procedures

## Paperwork

As most paperwork at a WWTP constitutes legal plant records, always remember to:

  - Write in black or blue ink.
  - Do not use whiteout, scratch out, alter, or deface paperwork.
  
Instead, if you make a mistake draw a single line through the error, write the correct information next to the error, then date and initial the correction.

### Lab Worksheet

Date:______| Lab OOD: ______| Lic. #: ______
-----------|----------------|---------------

Write the current date, your name (if you're the operator of the day), and your license number. Trainees should put down the license number of the lead operator.

#### CCV Online Meters Effluent

Consists of three blocks, CCC #2, CCC #1, plus an extra block of cells. **The first two MUST be filled out daily.** The third is an extra, in the event that one of the meters is out of range and needs to be recalibrated and rechecked.

<table>
  <tr><td>Initials</td><td colspan=2>CCC #2</td></tr>
  <tr><td></td><td>Sampled</td><td>Tested</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Time:</td><td></td><td></td></tr>
  <tr><td>Test</td><td>CL 17 #2</td><td>pH #2</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Range</td><td>+/- 10</td><td>+/- 0.2</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Meter</td><td></td><td></td></tr>
  <tr><td>Lab</td><td></td><td></td></tr>
  <tr><td>% Different</td><td></td><td></td></tr>
  <tr><td>Turb</td><td></td></tr>
  <tr><td>NO<sub>3</sub></td><td></td></tr>
</table>

  - Enter the initials of the operator performing the CCV (continuing calibration verification) of the CCC meters.
  - The time that the effluent sample is pulled at the CCC sampling point (sink).
  - The time that the test is started.
  - The reading on the CL17 Cl<sub>2</sub> meter.
  - The reading on the pH meter.
  - The CL17 Cl<sub>2</sub> measurement in the lab.
  - The pH measurement in the lab.
  - The percentage difference between the Cl<sub>2</sub> meter reading and the Cl<sub>2</sub> measurement.
  ```
  Calculating percentage difference:
  
  Subtract the smaller of the numbers from the larger number, 
    then divide the difference by the larger measurement. 
    
  Multiply the number by 100 to obtain the percentage.
  
  Example: reading at meter was 3.28, measurement in lab was 3.08
   A) 3.28 - 3.08 = 0.2
   B) 0.2 ÷ 3.28 = 0.06
   C) 0.06 × 100 = 6%
  ```
  - The difference between the meter pH and the measured pH.
  - The turbidity -- from the sample pulled at the turbidity sample point.
  - The NO<sub>3</sub> of the effluent.

#### Ditch/RAS Tests

<table>
  <tr><td></td><td>Ditch</td><td>Ditch</td><td>Ditch</td><td>RAS</td><td>RAS</td><td>RAS</td></tr>
  <tr><td></td><td>#3</td><td>#4</td><td>#5</td><td>#3</td><td>#4</td><td>#5</td></tr>
  <tr><td>30 Min</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr>
  <tr><td>60 Min</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr>
  <tr><td>Spin %</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr>
  <tr><td>SVI </td><td></td><td></td></tr>
  <tr><td>pH  </td><td></td><td></td></tr>
  <tr><td>Temp</td><td></td><td></td></tr>
</table>

  - Enter the ditch and RAS settleability at 30 minutes, then at 60 minutes.
  - Enter the levels of the solids in the centrifuge (spin) tubes.
  - Enter the SVI (sludge volume index).
  ```
  Calculating SVI
  
  SVI = 30 Min (Settle Sludge Volume) ÷ MLSS (Mixed Liquor Suspended Solids) × 1,000
  
  Example: 30 Min SSV is 890, MLSS is 3,710
    890 ÷ 3,710 × 1,000 = 240
  ```
  - Enter the pH measured in the lab of ditches three through five.
  - Enter the ditch temperatures using the temp taken while taking dissolved oxygen levels.
