## Paperwork

As most paperwork at a WWTP constitutes legal plant records, always remember to:

  - Write in black or blue ink.
  - Do not use whiteout, scratch out, alter, or deface paperwork.
  
Instead, if you make a mistake draw a single line through the error, write the correct information next to the error, then date and initial the correction.
