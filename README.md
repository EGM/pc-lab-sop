# City of Palm Coast :poop: Lab :poop: Standard Operating Procedures

## Paperwork

As most paperwork at a WWTP constitutes legal plant records, always remember to:

  - Write in black or blue ink.
  - Do not use whiteout, scratch out, alter, or deface paperwork.
  
Instead, if you make a mistake draw a single line through the error, write the correct information next to the error, then date and initial the correction.

### Lab Worksheet

Date:______| Lab OOD: ______| Lic. #: ______
-----------|----------------|---------------

Write the current date, your name (if you're the operator of the day), and your license number. Trainees should put down the license number of the lead operator.

  - Enter the initials of the operator performing the CCV (continuing calibration verification) of the CCC meters.
  - The time that the effluent sample is pulled at the CCC sampling point (sink).
  - The time that the test is started.
  - The reading on the CL17 Cl<sub>2</sub> meter.
  - The reading on the pH meter.
  - The CL17 Cl<sub>2</sub> measurement in the lab.
  - The pH measurement in the lab.
  - The percentage difference between the Cl<sub>2</sub> meter reading and the Cl<sub>2</sub> measurement.
  ```
  Subtract the smaller of the numbers from the larger number, 
    then divide the difference by the larger measurement. 
    
  Multiply the number by 100 to obtain the percentage.
  
  Example: reading at meter was 3.28, measurement in lab was 3.08
   A) 3.28 - 3.08 = 0.2
   B) 0.2 / 3.28 = 0.06
   C) 0.06 * 100 = 6%
  ```
  - The difference between the meter pH and the measured pH.
  - The turbidity -- from the sample pulled at the turbidity sample point.
  - The NO<sub>3</sub> of the effluent.
